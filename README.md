# Machine-Learning-Bookcamp-Projects
This repository contains projects that I have created while learning about machine learning through the book "Machine Learning Bootcamp". The projects are aimed at helping me develop practical skills in machine learning, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and evaluation, and prediction. Each project includes code that demonstrates the implementation of various algorithms and techniques in Python, as well as a description of the problem, the dataset used, and the approach taken. Through these projects, I have gained a deeper understanding of how to apply machine learning to real-world problems and how to interpret the results of my models. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this repository can serve as a valuable resource for learning and applying machine learning techniques.
